# jackpot-data-analysis

## Project Overview
This project is a case study focused on analyzing past jackpot data to explore potential patterns or trends using SQL queries. The primary objective is to study the repeatability of occurrences, probability of combinations, and other data-driven insights to determine if there are any discernible patterns in the historical data of jackpot results.
Project Overview
This project is a case study focused on analyzing past jackpot data to explore potential patterns or trends using SQL queries. The primary objective is to study the repeatability of occurrences, probability of combinations, and other data-driven insights to determine if there are any discernible patterns in the historical data of jackpot results.

## Key Features
SQL-based Data Analysis: A series of SQL queries designed to explore different aspects of jackpot data, including occurrence frequency, repeatability, and probability of number combinations.
Custom Queries: Queries are tailored to study specific behaviors within the dataset to identify potential trends.
Exploratory Analysis: By investigating past data, the project aims to determine whether historical jackpot results exhibit any predictable patterns.

## Motivation
The idea for this case study emerged from the curiosity to understand if there is any underlying trend in jackpot outcomes and whether it can be used for predictive analysis. This project is a first step toward testing hypotheses around jackpot randomness and repeatability.

## Technologies Used
SQL: To execute queries on historical jackpot data and generate insights.
Data Visualization Tools (optional): To represent findings (if included later).


## Future Work
This project is intended to serve as a foundation for future research in analyzing large datasets and creating more sophisticated prediction algorithms using statistical methods and machine learning.
